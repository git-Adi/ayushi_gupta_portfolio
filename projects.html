                        <p>I collaborated with a bright group of people when I was at college to help mould the future of the well-known Irish business Lynott Jewellery. Our project had two main objectives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enhance the business's internal operations</li>
                            <li>Develop a strategy to support growth through franchising</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We spent time digging into their current structure, finding ways to make daily operations smoother, and reducing the pressure on the founder for every decision. We also mapped out a franchise strategy inspired by global brands like Pandora, including how Lynott could grow sustainably across Ireland and into Europe.</p>
                        <p>Working on this project gave me real-world experience in strategic planning, financial forecasting, and understanding what it takes to help a business grow while keeping its identity strong.</p>

                    <div class="project-body">
                        <p>I was part of a team that built a full expansion strategy for HappyCo, a US-based Proptech company looking to grow into Europe.</p>
                        <p>Finding out where and how HappyCo might have the greatest impact was our goal.</p>
                        <p>After doing a thorough analysis of several markets, with a particular emphasis on Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, we developed a detailed strategy to assist them in their launch and expansion. This included everything, from selecting the best partners and pricing structures to modifying their software to comply with regional regulations (such as GDPR).</p>
                        <p>We even suggested using Dublin as their European base to take advantage of its business-friendly environment.</p>
                        <p>I learnt a lot about worldwide strategy, market research, and how to adapt tech goods to new markets from this assignment. It also made me truly appreciate the backroom labour that goes into expanding a business internationally.</p>
